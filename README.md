TASK7: POWER-BI-MINI-DASHBOARD
Step 1 – Data Import & Setup
I used the market_fact dataset and confirmed fields like Sales, Profit, Order Quantity, and Prod_id. This was the base table I deployed for all visuals.
Step 2 – Data Cleaning & Relationships
I checked column consistency and noticed no Product_Category field. I used Prod_id as the key and mapped relationships where needed to dimension tables.
Step 3 – Initial KPIs
I created measures for Total Sales and Total Profit. I used these measures in KPI cards to show executive‑level metrics.
Step 4 – Additional Measures
I added supporting measures like Profit Margin and Order Quantity. I used these to expand analysis beyond raw totals.
Step 5 – Slicers & Filters
I deployed slicers for Prod_id, Cust_id, Ship_id, and Ord_id. I used these slicers to segment the dashboard and give it a new interactive look.
Step 6 – Professional Formatting
I aligned visuals using snap‑to‑grid, applied a consistent theme, and added titles. I used KPI cards grouped at the top to mimic executive dashboards.
Step 7 – KPI Expansion
I created KPI cards for Total Sales, Total Profit, and Top Product by Sales (using Prod_id). I used these to mimic standard business reporting dashboards.
Step 8 – Testing & Validation
I tested the dashboard by selecting slicers and verifying visuals updated correctly. I used multi‑selection, cleared filters, and drill‑through to confirm no errors appeared
