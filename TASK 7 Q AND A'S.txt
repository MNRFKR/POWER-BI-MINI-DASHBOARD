What is a KPI and why is it used?
A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is a metric like Sales or Profit that tracks business performance; it’s used to quickly show whether goals are being met.
Difference between Measures and Calculated Columns?
Measures are calculations done on the fly (like SUM of Sales) and change with filters, while Calculated Columns are stored values created row‑by‑row in the dataset.
Why slicers are important in dashboards?
Slicers let users filter data interactively, making visuals respond instantly and allowing focused analysis without changing the underlying dataset.
What makes a dashboard professional?
Professional dashboards have aligned visuals, consistent themes, clear titles, and KPI cards that highlight key metrics in a clean, executive‑ready layout.
How do you ensure visuals match business requirements?
You validate by testing slicers, checking measures, and confirming visuals reflect the intended metrics and insights stakeholders need.
